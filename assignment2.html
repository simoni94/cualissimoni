<h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Step 2:</h3>

<p>Undergraduate teacher’s lesson topic: tobacco use</p>

<h4 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Nielsen’s heuristics: Analysis of The Tower Archive (supporting teacher’s lesson topic)</h4>

<ol>
<li>Visibility of system status: The system responds quickly to search actions of key terms (tobacco use, smoking, cigarettes, tobacco) and clicks, and while content is loading, a round loading spinner appears to let the user know the system is working and responding.</li>
<br>    

<li>Match between system and the real world: The page uses clear language for users to understand and it maintains a consistent style throughout. The search bar and some of the navigation labels could be more clearly labelled “JSTOR” or “Catholic University” because it can be confusing for new users to identify which collection set they are interacting with. Boolean operators do not seem to be very effective when searching key terms.</li>     
<br>

<li>User control and freedom:  The navigation allows the user to easily access and search different parts of the archive.  There are clear options to go back and retrace steps to access different serials and collections.  There are also options to refine search results, but these options could be more robust and specific to help users find what they are looking for more easily, especially because the results are not always relevant to the search terms.  Furthermore, the user cannot directly search each issue of The Tower to find desired key terms within an issue.</li>    
<br>

<li>Consistency and standards: The layout and elements such as, headings, descriptions, navigation bars, and search functions are consistent and follow the standard design of academic and archive websites.  They are for the most part consistent across the website.  Some of the descriptions on the results page after a search query are inconsistent.  Also, different amounts of information are included next to each thumbnail.  For example, sentences within the document featuring the key terms (tobacco, cigarettes, tobacco use, smoking) are displayed on the results page, while some of the results do not show how the terms are relevant to the issue of The Tower.</li>   
<br> 

<li>Error prevention: There were no errors as a result of any inputs and I did not come across any broken links. Content loaded fairly quickly.  Furthermore, there was confirmation (loading wheels) sent back to the user that the system was responding or working when the user used the search function or clicked buttons and links.</li>    
<br>

<li>Recognition rather than recall: Recent searches or clicked items (issues of The Tower) are not displayed or shown anywhere on the webpages, which forces the user to remember what they searched or clicked on if they want to go back to it.  There is a "save article" option, but the user needs to decide to save the article right away if they want to be able to go back to it, rather than continuing to do research and being able to access past content that was viewed.  There is an option to click back to the results or go back to the collection (based on time period) that the issue is in.  There is no ability to go back to previously viewed or searched items.</li>    
<br>

<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use: The website provides quick access to whole issues of The Tower and search functions.  The user has to click very few times to get to new content.  There could be more filters for advanced search options and ability to search each issue with key terms, as this would save the user time when trying to determine if a serial actually has what they are looking for. The results are also often either irrelevant to the search terms or the results page fails to show how the results relate to the searched terms.  I had to read many pages of each issue to find the terms "smoking" and "tobacco use."  There is no index of the stories within each issue, which can be limiting and not time efficient during the research process.  There are no filtering options to narrow down articles in an issue by genre, so if the user is looking for ads, opinion columns, or any other type of story, there is no way to narrow results.</li>   
<br> 

<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design: The design is relatively simple with a clear focus on search functions and the collection.  The layout is focused on highlighting and accessing the collection.</li>
<br>    

<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: When no results are found after a search, some general suggestions are made to improve searching, but there could be a more robust and detailed search recovery process such as suggesting related key terms ("tobacco" or "cigarettes" instead of "tobacco use") or topics. I initially searched "tobacco use," but found more relevant content when using synonyms of the term.  </li>   
<br>

<li>Help and documentation: There is a “support” page and a “search help” page with valuable information, but it is general and for all of JSTOR.  It would be helpful to include CUA archive specific support as well.</li>  
</ol>

<h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Step 3:</h3>

<h4 style="color: Black; font-weight: bold;">Weakness #1- Recognition rather than recall</h4>

<p>The website does not display recent searches or previously viewed items, meaning users need to rely on memory if they want to go back to them.  There is a “save article” option, but this is a step in which the user needs to be proactive and they must make the decision to save the issue immediately.  This makes it harder to navigate through previous research over time and users, who are doing research or looking through serials, may be unable to keep track of what they have already seen.  This increases the mental effort of the user and makes the research process less efficient. </p>

<img src="weakness1.jpg" width="500" height="200">

<h4 style="color: Black; font-weight: bold;">Weakness #2- Flexibility and efficiency of use</h4>

<p>Results are often not relevant to the searched terms and fail to display how the search terms relate to the results.  The search features lack advanced search options and the filters could be more granular in order to yield desired and relevant results.  Searching is also not permitted on the document of the serial itself, making it inefficient and difficult for the user to find the desired content and key terms in the result (serial).  Users would also benefit from being able to search by article or genre of story.  An index of all the articles in each issue could be beneficial for users.  The index could have links to each article so that the user does not need to skim an entire issue to find the information they are looking for.  Enhancing the search filters and results filters, as well as enabling users to search key terms within each issue would give users more control and make the system more efficient for use.  Search term relevance clearly displayed next to each thumbnail on the results page would also improve the user experience.</p>

<img src="weakness2.jpg" width="500" height="300">

<h4 style="color: Black; font-weight: bold;">Strength #1- Visibility of system status</h4>

<p>The website provides feedback for the user when the user interacts with the website, such as a loading spinner when the user is waiting for results or when content is loading.  This lets the user know the system is actively working and increases trust in the system.  The immediate feedback keeps users informed about the process and validates that their actions are being processed, making the experience more positive and user-friendly.</p>

 <img src="strength1.jpg" width="500" height="300">

<h4 style="color: Black; font-weight: bold;">Strength #2- Aesthetic and minimalist design</h4>


<p>The system has a simple and clean design with a focus on key functions, particularly searching and accessing the collection.  It is designed in a consistent manner, making it predictable for users, thus easier to learn and use because they know what to expect.  The minimalist design ensures that users aren’t overwhelmed or distracted by unnecessary elements and features.  The research components and access to The Tower collection are the priority and focus of the website design.</p>

<img src="strength2.jpg" width="500" height="300">

<h2 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; text-align: center;">Part 2- Usability Test</h2>

<h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Step 4:</h3>

<p>Observation and questionnaire submitted separately.</p>

<h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Step 5:</h3>

<p>The user was quickly engaged in operating the system and enjoyed browsing the historical editions of the Tower to find the information he was looking for.  He had the freedom to explore and was easily able to access issues from a variety of time periods due to the organizational layout of the collection, though the search function did not always provide relevant results.  It was easy for him to find the first edition and he later compared it to editions from various eras including the 1940's, 1960's, and 1990's. This aligns with the heuristic analysis of the system, which showed easy navigation through the collection and serials, however the user had to spend time manually browsing issues to locate relevant information because it lacks an efficient search function.  The design of the website helped the user get started quickly, but the search capabilities hindered the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find the needed information. I recommend including a feature in which the searched terms show up highlighted in The Tower issue, so that the user knows exactly where to look. </p>

<p>In order to find the perspectives on campus about WW2 and the Vietnam War, the user attempted to use the search function to find mentions of war in the collection.  Those searches came up with no results. In order to find the information, he relied on prior knowledge and recall to search the collection by dates, specifically searching December 1941 and May 1970.  Comparatively, when I was searching the website for content on tobacco use from the perspective of an undergraduate teacher, even though the search function was able to yield some relevant results, there were other results that were irrelevant.  This shows that the search function does not meet the user’s expectations or needs, as both users were looking to find content and articles on specific topics across the collection. I recommend improving the scope of search functions and creating more robust search filters in order to significantly enhance the user’s experience. Including search term relevance for each result on the results page would also improve the research process.</p>

<p>Both the heuristics analysis and the usability test show that the system is cleanly and simply designed with an interface that makes navigation easy for the user.  However, the system struggles with advanced search options and is limited in how users can find their information, making the research process inefficient.  The user had difficulties finding articles and content using keywords, and relied on prior knowledge of dates.  Furthermore, the inability to search within the issues or by stories highlights the need for improvements on flexibility and efficiency. I recommend incorporating a feature to be able to search by title of stories or genres of stories, enhance search and results filters, and allow users to search terms within individual issues. An index featuring the titles of all the articles in each issue would also be beneficial for users during the research process, as it could have links to each article that the user does not need to skim an entire issue to find the key terms or articles they are looking for. This would give users more control and make the research process more efficient.  </p>
