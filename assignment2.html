<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;ol&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Visibility of system status: The system responds fairly quickly to search actions and clicks, and while content is loading, a round loading spinner appears to let the user know the system is working and responding.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Match between system and the real world: The page uses clear language for users to understand and it maintains a consistent style throughout that is consistent with the conventions of databases and academic websites.  The search bar and some of the navigation labels could more clearly be labelled “JSTOR” or “Catholic University” because it can be confusing for new users to identify which collection set they are interacting with.&lt;/li&gt;     </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;User control and freedom:  The navigation allows the user to easily access and search different parts of the archive.  There are clear options to go back and access different serials and collections.  There are also options to refine search results, but these options could be more robust and specific to help users more easily find what they are looking for, especially because the results are not always relevant to the search terms.  Furthermore, the user cannot directly search each issue to find desired key terms within the document.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Consistency and standards: The layout and elements like headings, descriptions, navigation bars, and search functions are consistent and follow standards of academic and archive websites and for the most part are consistent across the website.  Some of the descriptions in the results page after a search are inconsistent, in that more or less information is included.  For example, sentences within the document featuring the key terms are displayed on the results page, while some of the results do not have this specificity.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Error prevention: I did not notice any major errors. I found  no broken links and content loaded fairly quickly.  There was confirmation sent back to the user that the system was responding or working when the user used the search function or clicked buttons and links.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Recognition rather than recall: Recent searches or clicked items (issues of The Tower) are not displayed or shown anywhere on the webpages, making the user need to remember what they searched or clicked on if they want to go back to it.  There is a save article option, but the user needs to decide to save the article right away if they want to be able to go back to it, rather than continuing to do research and being able to access past content that was viewed.  There is an option to click back to the results or go back to the collection the issue is in, but that is still limiting in terms of being able to go back to previously viewed or searched items.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and efficiency of use: The website provides quick access to articles and search functions.  The user has to click very few times to get to desired content.  There could be more filters for advanced search options and ability to search each issue, as this would save the user time when trying to determine if a serial actually has what they are looking for.  The results are also often either irrelevant to the search terms or the results page fails to show how the results relate to the searched terms.  Users are not permitted to search by stories in the issues, which can be limiting and not time efficient for research purposes.  There are no filtering options for type of content either, so if the user is looking for ads, opinion columns, or any other type of story, there is no way to narrow results.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Aesthetic and minimalist design: The design is relatively simple with a clear focus on search functions and the collection.  The layout is focused on highlighting the collection and access to the collection.&lt;/li&gt;    </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: When no results are found after a search, some general suggestions are made to improve searching, but there could be a more robust and detailed search recovery process such as suggesting related key terms or topics.&lt;/li&gt;   </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;li&gt;Help and documentation: There is a “support” page and a “search help” page with valuable information, but it is general and for all of JSTOR.  It would be helpful to include CUA archive specific support as well.&lt;/li&gt;  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;/ol&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The website does not display recent searches or previously viewed items, meaning users need to rely on memory if they want to go back to them.  There is a “save article” option, but this is a step in which the user needs to be proactive and they must make the decision to save the serial immediately.  This makes it harder to navigate through previous research and findings over time and users who are doing research or looking through serials may be unable to keep track of what they have already seen.  This increases the cognitive load of the user and makes the research process less efficient. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Results are often not relevant to the searched terms and fail to display how the search terms relate to the results.  The search features lack advanced searches and the filters could be more granular in order to yield desired and relevant results.  Searching is also not permitted on the document of the serial itself, making it inefficient and difficult for the user to find the desired content and key terms in the result (serial).  Users would also benefit from being able to search by story or type of story.  Enhancing search filters and results filters, as well as enabling users to search within individual issues would provide more control and efficiency for users.  Search term relevance clearly displayed on the results page would also improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The website provides feedback for the user when the user interacts with the website, such as a loading spinner when waiting for results or when content is loading.  This lets the user know the system is actively working and increases trust in the season.  The immediate feedback keeps users informed about the process and validates that their actions are being processed, making the experience more positive and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The system has a simple and clean design with a focus on key functions, particularly searching and accessing the collection.  It is designed in a consistent manner, making it predictable for users, thus easier to learn and use because they know what to expect.  The minimalist design ensures that users aren’t overwhelmed or distracted by unnecessary elements and features.  The research and access to The Tower serials remain the priority and focus in the website design.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Step 4:&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Observation and questionnaire submitted separately.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h3 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Step 5:&lt;/h3&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The user was quickly engaged in operating the system and enjoyed browsing the collections to find the information he was looking for.  He had the freedom to explore and was easily able to access issues from a variety of time periods due to the organization layout of the collection, though the search function did not always provide relevant results.  This aligns with the heuristic analysis of the system, which showed easy navigation through the collection and serials, however the user had to spend time manually browsing issues to locate relevant information because it lacks an efficient search function.  The design of the website helped the user get started quickly, but the search capabilities hindered the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find the needed information. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The user initially struggled to find the desired information when using the search function, so he relied on prior knowledge and recall to search the collection by dates.  This shows that the search function does not meet the user’s expectations or needs, as they were looking to find content and articles on specific topics across the collection. Improving the scope of search functions and creating more robust search filters would significantly enhance the user’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Both the heuristics analysis and the usability test show that the system is cleanly and simply designed with an interface that makes navigation easy for the user.  However, the system struggles with advanced search options and is limited in how users can find their information, making the research process inefficient.  The user had difficulties finding articles and content using keywords, and relied on prior knowledge of dates.  Furthermore, the inability to search within the issues or by stories highlights the need for improvements on flexibility and efficiency. I recommend incorporating a feature to be able to search by story or genre of story, enhance search and results filters, and allow users to search within individual issues.  This would give users more control and make the research process more efficient.  Including search term relevance for each result on the results page would also improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
