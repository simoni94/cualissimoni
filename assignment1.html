<h1 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; text-align: center;">System Introduction</h1>

<p>Context: <a href="https://hdl.huntington.org/" target="_blank">Huntington Digital Library</a> is an online database that houses digitized forms of the Huntington Library’s collection.  The Huntington library has over 11 million items in its collection, but only a small number of these items are digitized.    The digital library is regularly updated with new content.  The Huntington Library was founded in 1919 and the new digital library was made in 2011.</p>

<p>Users: According to the website, the Huntington Digital Library is intended to assist the research of Huntington readers and staff, as well as share information with the greater community. It makes the collection of the Huntington Library accessible to users around the world.</p>

<p>Content: The Huntington Digital Library website is an online database. Each object or item’s catalog record includes a variety of information including: title, creator, date, call number, physical description, notes, biographical notes, subjects, provenance, cataloging notes, and more.  The digital library is searchable with advanced search options or you can browse by featured categories.  Some of the featured categories are listed below.</p>

<h1 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; text-align: center;">Discussion</h1>

The Huntington Digital Library integrates a vast amount of metadata for the descriptions of each item.  The metadata includes information about the digitization specifics of each object. They also offer an interactive experience for viewing digital representations of items– there are zooming and rotating features.  The records of some objects include links that connect an item back to its collection or electronic finding aid, as well as links to other electronic resources that can add more context to an object.  

<h4 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mobile device friendly</li>
<li>It is regularly updated with new information</li>
<li>“Save items” feature so that users and researchers can organize their information and easily access it again</li>
<li>Has made a variety of special and rare information available digitally so people from around the world can access it</li>
<li>High-resolution digital images and scans</li>
<li>User-friendly design and navigation</li>
<li>Response-time is quick when accessing web pages and loading media</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color: DarkOliveGreen; font-weight: bold;">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The library’s entire catalog is not digitized so access to information is limited compared to in-person access </li>
<li>The digital library webpages and catalog records are written in English and no translating options are offered, therefore users must know English or know how to use digital translators to access the digital library </li>
</ul>


<h4 style="color: DarkOliveGreen;">Suggestions for Improvement: </h4>
<p>I believe the Huntington Digital Library is a very well-organized and intentional project. I would suggest offering more virtual exhibitions to highlight a variety of materials in the collection and to make this information accessible for people who cannot go to the physical library.  More accessibility features could also be added for users who may be visually impaired– I would have loved an easily identifiable button I could click to hear descriptions of items.  Multilingual options could also be included to make the content accessible to even more people.  </p>
